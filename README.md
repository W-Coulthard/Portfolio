# Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio website that showcases my work as a software developer. The website features an about me section, a project section, and a contact section.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design of the website is responsive and optimized for all devices. It uses the Google Fonts API to import the Poppins font and Font Awesome for icons.

The website also includes a video background on the homepage which is an mp4 file. The website also includes a hamburger menu to enhance the user experience on smaller screens.

To run the project locally, you will need to have a web server running on your machine and point it to the root directory of the project. You can also use a service like GitHub Pages to host the project.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me through the contact form on the website or by visiting my LinkedIn or GitHub profiles.
